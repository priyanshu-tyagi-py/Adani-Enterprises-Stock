This project applies machine learning and time series analysis to predict and visualize stock price movements for Adani Enterprises. Below is a detailed explanation for your GitHub README, covering model choice, graph selection, and accuracy discussion.

Project Overview<br>
-> Cleaned and preprocessed historical stock data for Adani Enterprises using Python (Pandas, NumPy).

-> Engineered features with technical indicators (Moving Averages, Bollinger Bands, RSI, MACD) to capture price trends, volatility, and market momentum.

-> Applied seasonal decomposition to separate trend, seasonality, and residuals in the time series.

-> Built and evaluated machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression) to predict stock price direction.

Why This Model?<br>
-> Logistic Regression was chosen for its interpretability and effectiveness in binary classification tasks like predicting up/down price movement. It is a common baseline in financial prediction due to its simplicity and speed.

-> More complex models can be explored, but logistic regression provides a transparent starting point and helps avoid overfitting on limited or noisy financial data.

Why These Graphs?<br>
-> Time Series Plots: Show overall price trends and volatility, helping to visually assess long-term and short-term movements.

-> Candlestick Charts: Offer detailed insights into daily price action, including open, high, low, and close, which are valuable for understanding volatility and trader behavior.

-> Moving Averages (MA): Smooth out price data to highlight underlying trends and help identify support/resistance levels and trend reversals.

-> Bollinger Bands: Visualize price volatility and potential overbought/oversold conditions.

-> RSI & MACD: Gauge momentum and possible trend changes, aiding in the identification of bullish or bearish signals.

-> Volume Trends: Help confirm the strength of price moves; higher volume during breakouts or breakdowns signals conviction and possible trend continuation.

Why Is Model Accuracy Low?<br>
-> Stock price prediction is inherently difficult due to market complexity, noise, and the influence of unpredictable external events.

-> Logistic regression and similar models may underperform because they cannot capture all nonlinear relationships and dynamic factors present in real-world markets.

-> Data limitations: Financial data is often noisy, non-stationary, and may contain imbalanced classes (more ups than downs), which can bias model performance.

-> Market efficiency: Publicly available data is quickly priced in, making it hard for standard models to consistently outperform random guessing.

Key Takeaways<br>
-> This project demonstrates practical skills in data cleaning, feature engineering, technical analysis, and machine learning for financial data.

-> The chosen models and visualizations provide a strong foundation for further exploration with advanced AI/ML techniques or alternative data sources (e.g., news sentiment).

-> Lower accuracy is expected and reflects real-world challenges in financial prediction-highlighting the importance of combining models, technical indicators, and risk management in trading strategies.
